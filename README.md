# MPI_Repo

## Analysis
I couldn't run it on my jupyter notebook but I was able to run it on vscode. I feel this is what I could do I just used MPI_send and MPI_Receive which serves as a blocking communication which basically the  prints number of rows to each process, and the other processes receive these rows. I also used 2 nodes to execute the program.

## Result
Resultant Matrix C:
-1526224497 828338432 
76 100 
0 0 

Im not really sure but this is what I was able to output using blocking communication.
